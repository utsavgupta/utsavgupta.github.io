      <description>Photo by Markus Spiske on Unsplash -- Recently all our services were replicated to multiple data centers on Google Cloud Platform. The REST API services scaled well without any code changes. However the batch jobs and their schedulers needed attention to ensure we avoid any kind of race conditions.
Leader election is ubiquitous in today&amp;rsquo;s world of distributed computing. Knowingly or unknowingly we use a multitude of tools that make use of leader election to ensure systems run like clockwork.</description>

      <description>I have been playing around with Kubernetes in various settings for almost three years. Majority of it in production. Where the infrastructure was either setup and configured by experienced platform engineers, or it was hosted on Google as GKE clusters. My interaction with Kubernetes has been limited to mostly handling the deployments that I work on.
Recently I decided to start learning Kubernetes at a greater depth. So what better place to start than installing and configuring a multi node cluster on my laptop?</description>
