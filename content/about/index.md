I am a polyglot programmer with 4.5 years' professional experience in designing and developing scalable microservices. I am interested in architecting and developing solutions for the cloud. I also have a keen interest in [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/)(Site Reliability Engineering) practices.

I am experienced in building and maintaining enterprise level platform services. My project work includes developing an OAuth2 and SAML 2.0 compliant identity and access management system for a large German wholesaler, and a custom built ci/cd platform for one of Germany's largest discount retailers.

On the days I am not writing code one can find me pursuing my new found hobby of photography.
