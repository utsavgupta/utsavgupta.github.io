I am a polyglot programmer with 4.5 years' professional experience in designing and developing scalable microservices. I am interested in architecting and developing solutions for the cloud. I am also passionate about [SRE](https://landing.google.com/sre/)(Site Reliability Engineering) practices.

I have experience in developing a bespoke identity and access mangement system and a custom built Dev Ops platform for two of the largest German retailers. 

On the days I am not writing code one can find me pursuing my new found hobby of photography.
